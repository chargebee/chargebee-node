Consider an invoice with the following payments and tax withheld.

* Tax withheld: $5

When recording a refund worth $40, the refund amount is split as follows:

* Refund against offline payments: $30

* Refund against online payments: $5

**Tip**

If the order of precendence described above does not work for your use case, and you want to provide a refund against online &#x60;linked_payments&#x60; first, use the [Refund an invoice API](/docs/api/invoices#refund_an_invoice).
