**What is an &quot;in-term reactivation&quot;?**   
An &quot;in-term reactivation&quot; happens when the billing term of the subscription is retained upon cancellation and reactivation is initiated within that term.   

**When is the &#x27;billing term&#x27; retained for a cancelled subscription?**   
When dunning (payment failure retry settings) is configured with the last retry configured as

* cancel subscription and mark invoice as &#x27;Not Paid&#x27;, or
* cancel subscription and mark the invoice as &#x27;Voided&#x27; and the case if any of the current term invoices is partially or fully paid, the invoice is not voided but instead Chargebee marks the invoices as &#x27;Not Paid&#x27;.



**Note :** In both cases, the billing term is retained and upon reactivation the subscription will be moved to active state (if the plan does not have a trial period) and no invoice will be generated. Ensure that you collect any unpaid invoices.   

**Example :** A Subscription was billed from 1st to 31st of a month and it was cancelled on the 20th due to one of the above cases (billing term is not reset). If the reactivation happens on 25th then it is considered an in-term reactivation.

* There should be no [unbilled charges](/docs/api/unbilled_charges?prod_cat_ver&#x3D;2) for non-&#x60;metered&#x60; items for the current term.
* There should be no [unbilled charges](/docs/api/unbilled_charges?prod_cat_ver&#x3D;2) for &#x60;metered&#x60; items for the previous term.

#### deleting an invoice

Usages are also deleted when an invoice is deleted. Therefore, if the invoice was deleted, you may [add](/docs/api/usages?prod_cat_ver&#x3D;2#create_a_usage) or [bulk import](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/bulk-operations.html#overview_available-bulk-operations) usages before regenerating an invoice.

This API is used to resume a **paused** subscription. On resumption the subscription will be activated and any applicable charges will be initiated.

You could schedule the resumption by passing **specific_date** parameter in resume_option. If scheduled, the subscription will be resumed on the **specific_date** and moved to Active state.

For in-term resumption, unless there are scheduled changes, unbilled charges will not be charged.

**What is an &quot;in-term resumption&quot;?**   
An &quot;in-term resumption&quot; is when the pause and resumption happens within the billing term of the subscription.

**Example :** A subscription was billed from 1st to 31st of a month. It was paused on the 20th and resumed before 31st. This is an in-term resumption.

#### UNPAID INVOICES

Specifying **unpaid_invoices** allows you to close invoices of the subscription which have amounts due. The invoices are chosen for payment collection after applying the available credits and excess payments.

If specified as **schedule_payment_collection**, payment collection for the amount due of past invoices will be attempted. The payment method available will be charged if auto-collection is enabled for the customer, and appropriate payment collection(payment succeeded or payment failed) events will be triggered. If the payment collection fails, no further retries will be made on the invoices.

**Note:** If the invoices of the subscription are consolidated, and any of the subscriptions in the consolidated invoice are cancelled, these invoices will not be selected for collection.

        * @description **Note:** This operation optionally supports 3DS verification flow. To achieve the same, create the [Payment Intent](/docs/api/#3ds-implementation-guide) and pass it as input parameter to this API.

This API is used to reactivate a **cancelled** subscription. You may also optionally specify a trial end date, to move the subscription to **In Trial** state. If trial end is not specified, the subscription will be activated and any applicable charges will be initiated.

Unless the billing cycle is specified, it will be set to plan&#x27;s default billing cycle.

During an in-term reactivation^++^, unless the billing cycle is specified, the subscription&#x27;s remaining billing cycles will be restored. If a trial end date is specified, then the plan&#x27;s default billing cycle is used.

**What is an &quot;in-term reactivation&quot;?**   
An &quot;in-term reactivation&quot; happens when the billing term of the subscription is retained upon cancellation and reactivation is initiated within that term.   

**When is the &#x27;billing term&#x27; retained for a cancelled subscription?**   
When dunning (payment failure retry settings) is configured with the last retry configured as

* cancel subscription and mark invoice as &#x27;Not Paid&#x27;, or
* cancel subscription and mark the invoice as &#x27;Voided&#x27; and the case if any of the current term invoices is partially or fully paid, the invoice is not voided but instead Chargebee marks the invoices as &#x27;Not Paid&#x27;.



**Note :** In both cases, the billing term is retained and upon reactivation the subscription will be moved to active state (if the plan does not have a trial period) and no invoice will be generated. Ensure that you collect any unpaid invoices.   

**Example :** A Subscription was billed from 1st to 31st of a month and it was cancelled on the 20th due to one of the above cases (billing term is not reset). If the reactivation happens on 25th then it is considered an in-term reactivation.
