* [Create using temporary token](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_using_temporary_token)
* [Create using permanent token](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_using_permanent_token)
* [Create a card payment source](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_a_card_payment_source)

Adds or replaces card details of a customer. Updating card details replaces the present payment method.

Passing credit card details to this API involves PCI liability at your end as sensitive card info passes through your servers. If you wish to avoid that, you can use one of the following integration methodologies if applicable

* If you are using Stripe gateway, you can use [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js) with your card update form.
* If you are using Braintree gateway, you can use [Braintree.js](https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/javascript) with your card update form.
* If you are using Authorize.Net gateway, you use [Accept.js](https://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/acceptjs.html) with your card update form.
* In case you are using the Adyen gateway, you will have to use the Adyen&#x27;s [Client Side Encryption](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/classic-integrations/api-integration-ecommerce/cse-integration-ecommerce) to encrypt sensitive cardholder data. Once the cardholder data is encrypted, pass the value in adyen.encrypted.data as temp token in this API.
* You can also use our [Hosted Pages](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/hosted_pages.html) based integration. Use our [Hosted Page - Update Card](/docs/api/hosted_pages#update_card) API to generate a &#x27;Update Card&#x27; Hosted Page link.
